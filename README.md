# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Setup

This repository uses uv (https://uv.run/) as a python environment and package manager.

Each day has it's own directory and can be run with `uv run <name-of-python-file>`.

Example:

```bash
uv run 2025/01/main.py
```
